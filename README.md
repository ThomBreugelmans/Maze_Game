# Maze_Game
A maze game made by yours truly

## Description
This is a maze game generated using recursive backtracking, after the game is generated you will be able to play!

## How to play
To play this maze you simply need to start the webpage or navigate to https://thombreugelmans.github.io/Maze_Game/ and when the maze is loaded there will appear a red square in the top left corner, this is you. To move your player use the WASD keys. To win the game you need to move to the exit located somewhere on the top, right or bottom of the maze. If you won you will get a little surprise ;). To replay the game just reload the page.

## Rules
### Easy difficulty:
To be able to win this game mode the player simply needs to locate the exit and move to it.

### Medium difficulty
To be able to leave this maze the player must first collect all coins that get spawned randomly, after the last coin has been collected the exit will become visible.

### Hard difficulty
This is for players that find the medium difficulty way too easy, you will be put in the maze where you need to collect coins like the medium difficulty. But the catch is you will only be able to see in a small radius around you, good luck.

### Monster difficulty
This is for the hardened veterans, this game mode is the same as the hard difficulty with as the only catch, your see radius is smaller and the maze is 2 times bigger... May the force be with you.
